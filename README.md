I've some pretty fun plans for the london underground data but this is mostly me just testing out scripting in node

Original CSV files sourced from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_geographic_maps/CSV
I'm probably gonna tweak the original SQL and include the modified SQL set here too

Changes/extensions will be applied as I find them, and these files may be replaced by better alternatives at a later date.
Numerous stations are not included in the given dataset (e.g. Stratford International), for the purposes of simplicity, I shall skip those here.

Line order will be determined on the basis of North to South and West to East for the majority of the time but I won't focus on it so much. Lines with multiple variations are treated as multiple different lines here

Possible Explorations:
 - Modular tracks
 - Adding new stations (lets get the DLR right, at least?)


I've rebuilt the relational database but the links currently have a lot of redundant entries I'll remove soon via queries
